# fmajor

`fmajor` is a self-hosted file upload service. It is basic, but easy
to install.

## Features

* Upload, download and delete files all from the web interface.

* `fmajor` is compiled to one static binary, which includes all
  resources. This makes deployment easy, no need for containers
  or virtual machines.

* Doesn't require a database. All data is stored on the file system.

## What it Doesn't Do

* Authentication and Authorization. You'll have to use a proxy like
  `nginx` with basic authentication if you don't want random people on
  the internet uploading files to your server.

## Install

The following instructions were tested on Debian 10 and assume that
you know how to proxy and secure HTTP services with something like
`nginx`.

1. Make sure all prerequisites are installed. You will need `git` and
   `go` version 1.13 or later.

2. Download, build and install the `fmajor` program.

		$ go get github.com/kissen/fmajor
		$ go build github.com/kissen/fmajor

   You should now have an `fmajor` binary in your working directory.
   Copy it to a reasonable location on the file system.

		# cp fmajor /usr/bin/fmajor

3. Create a dedicated user for running `fmajor`.

		# adduser --home /var/lib/fmajor --shell /sbin/nologin --disabled-password fmajor

   This creates a user named `fmajor` with home directory `/var/lib/fmajor`
   which is where we will let `fmajor` put all its uploads.

4. Copy the configuration file to `/etc`.

		# wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kissen/fmajor/master/doc/fmajor.conf
		# mv fmajor.conf /etc/fmajor.conf

   You should now have a configuration file `/etc/fmajor.conf`. Open
   it with a text editor and edit it to your liking.

5. Install the `systemd` service file.

		# wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kissen/fmajor/master/doc/fmajor.service
		# mv fmajor.service /lib/systemd/system/fmajor.service
		# systemctl daemon-reload

6. You can now start the `fmajor` service with

		# systemctl start fmajor

   which will make `systemd` take care of keeping your logs. Access
   the logs using

		# journalctl -u fmajor.service

   If you want `fmajor` to start during boot, enable the service with
   `systemctl` like so

		# systemctl enable fmajor


7. `fmajor` listens to the `ListenAddress` defined in configuration
   file `/etc/fmajor.conf`. Per default, this is `localhost` which of
   course isn't very useful if you want to access the service
   remotely. To make `fmajor` accessible on the open internet,
   configure your reverse proxy (e.g. `nginx`) to forward requests to
   `ListenAddress`.

   Because `fmajor` doesn't have any access control built in, you should
   have your proxy take care of it. [HTTP Basic Auth](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/security-controls/configuring-http-basic-authentication/)
   is the easiest way.

   You should also configure your reverse proxy to use HTTPS, otherwise
   third parties will be able to listen on what you are uploading
   and downloading. [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) with
   [Certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/) is the canonical choice.
