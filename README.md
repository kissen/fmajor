# fmajor

`fmajor` is a self-hosted file upload service. It is very basic, but
easy to install.

## Features

* Upload, download and delete files all from the web interface.

* `fmajor` is compiled to one static binary, which includes all
  resources. This makes deployment very easy, no need for containers
  or virtual machines.

* Doesn't require a database. All data is stored on the file system.

## What it Doesn't Do

* Authentication and Authorization; there isn't any. You'll have
  to use a proxy like `nginx` with basic authentication if you don't
  want random people on the internet uploading files on your server.

## Install

The following instructions were tested on Debian 10, but installation
on any `systemd` based system should be about the same. If you aren't
using `systemd`, you probably know what to do differently.
