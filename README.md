# fmajor

`fmajor` is a self-hosted file upload service. It is basic, but easy
to install.

![Screenshot of fmajor running in Firefox](doc/screenshot.png)

## Features

* Upload, download and delete files all from the web interface.  Only
  users with a password can upload and delete file but *everyone can
  download all uploaded files assuming they have the link*.

* `fmajor` is compiled to one static binary, which includes all
  resources. This makes deployment easy, no need for containers or
  virtual machines.

* Doesn't require a database. All data is stored on the file system.

## What it Doesn't Do

* `fmajor` does not include transport encryption (i.e. HTTPS). Please
  use a proxy like `nginx` with TLS enabled to ensure that nobody
  listens to your login password.

## Building

Assuming you have `go` version 1.17 or later, you should only have to run

    $ go install github.com/kissen/fmajor@latest

You should now have `fmajor` available on your system.

## Setup With `systemd`

The following instructions were tested on Debian 10 and assume that
you know how to proxy and secure HTTP services with something like
`nginx`.

1. Build `fmajor` like explained in the previous section. You can do
   this on your workstation.

2. Move the `fmajor` binary to a reasonable place on your server.
   This tutorial assumes that place to be `/usr/bin/fmajor`. All following
   commands need to be run on your server as `root`.

3. Create a dedicated user for running `fmajor`.

        # adduser --home /var/lib/fmajor --shell /sbin/nologin --disabled-password fmajor

   This creates a user named `fmajor` with home directory `/var/lib/fmajor`
   which is where we will let `fmajor` put all its uploads.

4. Copy the configuration file to `/etc`.

        # wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kissen/fmajor/master/doc/fmajor.conf
        # mv fmajor.conf /etc/fmajor.conf

   You should now have a configuration file `/etc/fmajor.conf`.

5. You need to set up at least one password. Without a password,
   you will not be able to log in and therefore upload files.

   The easiest way is to use the `htpasswd` tool to generate the
   hash. On Debian, you can get `htpasswd` with the `apache2-utils`
   package. With it installed, run

        $ htpasswd -n -B -C 12 "" | tr -d ':\n'

   and you will be prompted for the password. The hash is printed to
   `stdout`.

   Open `/etc/fmajor.conf` with a text editor and edit section
   `PassHashes` accordingly. It should look something like

        PassHashes = [
            "$2y$12$uTLL4JVVyJg9aunt.hyraej3m0yW6siY2cAQ1MakmUxtxgR4EoPbK"
        ]

6. Install the `systemd` service file.

        # wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kissen/fmajor/master/doc/fmajor.service
        # mv fmajor.service /lib/systemd/system/fmajor.service
        # systemctl daemon-reload

7. You can now start the `fmajor` service with

        # systemctl start fmajor

   which will make `systemd` take care of keeping your logs. Access
   the logs using

        # journalctl -u fmajor.service

   If you want `fmajor` to start during boot, enable the service with
   `systemctl` like so

        # systemctl enable fmajor


8. `fmajor` listens to the `ListenAddress` defined in configuration
   file `/etc/fmajor.conf`. Per default, this is `localhost` which of
   course isn't very useful if you want to access the service
   remotely. To make `fmajor` accessible on the open internet,
   configure your reverse proxy (e.g. `nginx`) to forward requests to
   `ListenAddress`.

   You should configure your reverse proxy to use HTTPS, otherwise
   third parties will be able to spy on your interactions with
   `fmajor`.  [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) with
   [Certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/) is the canonical choice.
